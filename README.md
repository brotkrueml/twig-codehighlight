# Twig extension for code highlighting

[![CI](https://github.com/brotkrueml/twig-codehighlight/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brotkrueml/twig-codehighlight/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This package provides a Twig extension for server-side code highlighting. Under the
hood, the [scrivo/highlight.php](https://github.com/scrivo/highlight.php) package is
used which does the hard work. You can use every
[theme provided for highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/demo).

An addition to the highlighting of code this Twig extension provides additional
(opinionated) features:

- [language aliases](#language-aliases)
- [additional languages](#additional-languages)
- [line numbers](#line-numbers)
- [emphasize lines](#emphasize-lines)
- [classes](#classes)
- [list of available languages](#list-of-available-languages)

> This package is in beta phase! You can use it already, but API might change.

## Usage

Add the extension to the Twig environment:

```php
$twig->addExtension(new Brotkrueml\TwigCodeHighlight\Extension());
```

Use it in Twig templates:
```twig
{{ "<?php echo 'test'; ?>" | codehighlight("php") }}
```

If the language is not available, a raw code block is displayed.

It is also possible to inject a logger that implements `\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`
to display warnings when a given language is not available, either via dependency
injection or manually:

```php
$twig->addExtension(new Brotkrueml\TwigCodeHighlight\Extension($myLogger));
```

You can also use named arguments, the example above can be also written like:

```twig
{{ "<?php echo 'test'; ?>" | codehighlight(language="php") }}
```

This will render something like this:

```html
<pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>; <span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span></code></pre>
```

### Language aliases

When you have already an existing application with languages named alternatively than highlight.php
provides them, you can assign an array of language aliases when instantiating the extension class:

```php
$twig->addExtension(new Brotkrueml\TwigCodeHighlight\Extension(languageAliases: ['text' => 'plaintext', 'sh' => 'shell']));
```

In this example, we introduce `text` as an alias for `plaintext` and `sh` for `shell`.


### Additional languages

Sometimes you have the need to add languages which are not shipped by the
`scrivo/highlight.php` package. You can add one or more custom languages:

```php
$twig->addExtension(new Brotkrueml\TwigCodeHighlight\Extension(
    additionalLanguages: [
        ['custom_language', '/path/to/the/custom_language.json'],
        ['another_language', '/path/to/the/another_language.json', true],
    ]
));
```

The array consists of the following values:

- The language ID (here: `custom_language` and `another_language`) - required
- The full path to the language (here: `/path/to/the/custom_language.json` and `/path/to/the/another_language.json`) - required
- Should this language override a provided one (default: `false`, set to `true` if it should override) - optional


### Line numbers

By default, no line numbers are displayed. You can switch them one by setting the second argument:

Use it in Twig templates:
```twig
{{ "<?php echo 'test'; ?>" | codehighlight(language="php", showLineNumbers=true) }}
```

Line numbers start with `1`, but can also give a custom start number with another argument:

```twig
{{ "<?php echo 'test'; ?>" | codehighlight(language="php", showLineNumbers=true, startWithLineNumber=11) }}
```

This adds a `<span data-line-number="x">...</span>` to each line, where `x` is the increasing line number.

You can then use a CSS rule to display the line number, for example:

```css
code [data-line-number]::before {
    content: attr(data-line-number);
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 1em;
    text-align: right;
    width: 2ch;
}
```

### Emphasize lines

You can emphasize lines which highlights one or more lines in a code snippet.

Use it in Twig templates:
```twig
{{ code | codehighlight(language="php", emphasizeLines="1-3,5") }}
```

This example emphasizes the lines 1,2,3 and 5.

This adds a `<span data-emphasize-line>...</span>` to each line which should be emphasized.

You can then use a custom CSS rule to highlight the line, for example:

```css
code [data-emphasize-line] {
    background: lightcyan;
}
```

### Classes

There are two ways to set or more classes to the `<pre>` tag:

1.  To set the classes in an application use the `classes` constructor argument when instantiating the
    Twig extension:

    ```php
    $twig->addExtension(new Brotkrueml\TwigCodeHighlight\Extension(classes: 'some-default-class'));
    ```

    Which results in the following HTML code:

    ```html
    <pre class="some-default-class">...</pre>
    ```

2. You can add one or more additional classes to the `<pre>` tag for a special code block:

    ```twig
    {{ some text | codehighlight(language="plaintext", classes="some-special-class another-special-class") }}
    ```

    Which results in the following HTML code:

    ```html
    <pre class="some-special-class another-special-class"><code class="hljs plaintext">some text</code></pre>
    ```

Using both variants together results in the following HTML code:

```html
<pre class="some-default-class some-special-class another-special-class"><code class="hljs plaintext">some text</code></pre>
```

### List of available languages

Sometimes it can be useful to provide a list of available languages. The function `codehighlight_languages()`
is available to output such a list:

```twig
<ul>
{% for language in codehighlight_languages() %}
    <li>{{ language }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```
